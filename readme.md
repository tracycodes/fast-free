An easy to use student loan calculator to help visualize the impact of paying beyond the minimum payment on student loans.

## Goals

- Show loan drop off over time as payment is increased
- Show savings rate if minimum payment is not increased
- Add field for monthly possible contribution (if I put 1k dollars towards loans and 1k dollars towards savings, with a savings growth rate of x, the accounts will look like z after a period of time w), ability to adjust slider for different contributions.
